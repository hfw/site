Web I/O
========

`index.php`
---------

```php
<?php
include 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Helix\Site;
use Helix\Site\View;
$site = new Site;

// "GET /"
$site->get('/', fn() => 'Hello World');

// "GET /foo/123" (regex)
$site->get('#^/foo/(?<id>[0-9]+)$#', function(array $path) {
    return new View('view/foo.phtml', [
        'id' => (int)$path['id']
    ]);
});
```

`view/foo.phtml`
--------------

```php
<?php
/**
 * @var Helix\Site\View $this
 * @var int $id 
 */
echo $id;
```

Under the Hood
--------------

- The `Site` constructor takes care of general environment setup, including error handling and logging.
- If no routes matched, a `404` or `405` error is rendered.
- Each HTTP error code can have its own template. A generic template is used as a fallback.

Views
-----

`View` instances merely `include` their templates (`.phtml` files).

Within the scope of those files, `$this` refers to
the `View` instance itself. Any data given to the view is converted to variables via `extract()` in the
same scope as the template inclusion. Data can also be accessed via `ArrayAccess`.

By convention, templates should be stored in the `view` directory in the document root.

nginx config
------------

```
server {
    # ... server config ...
    location / {
        # ... fastcgi config ...
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/index.php;
    }
}
```
