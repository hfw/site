this is a hidden file.

this is accessible at "/static/.hidden.txt" because index.php lets the "static" directory pass.

this is not accessible at "/file/.hidden.txt" because index.php prevents downloading dotfiles.

in real life you should do static file access/protection in the web daemon, not the index.
